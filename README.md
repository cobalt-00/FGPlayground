# Cobalt's Fighting Game Playground

This is a Unity 6000.0.54f1 project primarily for my own personal enrichment. To check it out, you can pull the repository and open the project as is in the correct Unity version.
Currently supports dpad and dpad equivalents, tested using my HitboxArcade leverless controller. 

At its core, it aims to be a highly customizable set of core features to support a fighting game. At present, this consists of only an input reader 

Planned Features:
* **Input Reader**
  -
*  Support any arbitrary motion as defined by game needs
*  Support charge inputs
*  Support negative edge inputs
*  Support held input moves such as Flash Knuckle or Grave Reaper.
*  Support multiple controllers
*  Support rebindable inputs
*  Visual input display


* **Stretch Goals**
  -
*  Make a basic controllable character that consumes input data
*  Implement save state manager 
*  Figure out how to make a GGPO hook in for my old unity networking plugin
*  Maybe make an actual fighting game?
